#TODO-LIST :D

#support for complex numbers (C++)
#different log-bases (log2)
#add constants math.pi and math.e
#add functions with multiple arguments fun(,term-(-1),term-(-1),), lambda-functions ?



#KNOWN BUGS
#
# 1.doesn't modulo imaginary numbers (but stills plot the right value but without modulos)
# 2. sin(x)^101 is plotted with both real-imaginary and normal part..
#


#SUPPORTS
#
# 1. Complex constans in the form "a+bi" where, i = "1i" (Python)
# 2. Plotting Complexvalued functions by having a blue (real-part) and red (imag-part) (Python)
# 3. Conjugate complex functions including operators (Python)
# 4. Plot multiple functions seperated with ';'
# 5. Comparison operators (ex. heavside = (x>0) 
#


#TESTS (complex tests currently only works on Python)
#
# f = atan(log(sqrt(x)-1))^3 [works]
# f = log(x)^3/5 [works]
# f = +(log(x)) [works]
# f = *(log(x)) [works]
# f = sin(x)*(x>0) [works]
# f = (x>3)+(x>2)+(x>1)+(x>0) [works]
# f = sin(x) > 0 [works]
# f = sin(x);cos(x);-sin(x);-cos(x) [works [works]
# f = (1+1i)**asin(x)
